## Volt
*Support Frame. Buffs team with speed, reload speed and damage. Can use Ogris or Afentis with Afentis being more common experienced teams.* 

Often utilized in more experienced groups over Chroma as Volt's reload speed buff and dispensary are stronger at the cost of damage. Volt is also considerably harder to keep max strength dispensary up all the time due to lower duration. Volt's reload speed buff is also less consistent to apply compared to Chroma's.

### Strategy

On Defense you run Vazarin
On Interception you run Madurai
Madurai for more ability strength and Vazarin to bodyguard the Defense Operator in the later waves of the game

Cast dispensary at start to provide team with energy orbs for initial setup
Throw down a [Nidus] Specter and wait for him to tether to you
Get energy orb
Cast 4
DD with Operator
Get energy orb
Cast 2
DD with Operator
Get energy orb
Cast 1

Aim to be linked with nidus when casting buffs. Best way to insure that happens is by breaking link after recasting all buffs. This way Nidus will link to you when its time to recast buffs again.
